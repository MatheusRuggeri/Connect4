# Connect 4
The traditional game made with Python and C.
The code that you are download are configured with 6 lines, 7 columns and you have to connect 4 pieces to be the winner, but you can configure this values, set a larger board and maybe 5 pieces connected to win.

The C code was programmed in 2012, I lost the final version, this one has many intentation problems, but the code is working, the Python code is cleaner.
